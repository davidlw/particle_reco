From TMVA_massd1:

- Removed mass_dau1 tuning from TMVA
- Applied new dE/dx cuts on the KsProton branch
    y = k * (m / (x - a))^2 + c
    
    m = 0.9382720813
    
    k_high = 3.5
    c_high = 4.2
    a_high = 0.1
    cutoff: x = 2.5 (remove the upper bound for x over this cutoff point)

    k_low = 2.6
    c_low = 2.2
    a_low = -0.1
    cutoff: x = 2.2 (remove the lower bound for x over this cutoff point)
- Applied a fixed cut of nhits_dau2 >= 11 on the KsProton branch

- Changed backgroundBaseCuts to depend on signalBaseCuts

*** readxml changes ***
- Split readxml into 2 separate parts:
    - 1. Read entries, apply cuts found by myTMVA, and output histogram files
    - 2. Perform the fits on the histograms (wip)

- Set all TMVA analyses to use the same readxml/fitting macro.
- Changed readxml to read input file names from a single configuration file,
and to accept output file specifiers, allowing for job-splitting capabilities
- Put a parameter in the readxml configuration file to specify which the path to the
myTMVA folder to use
