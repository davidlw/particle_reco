--- Description ---
- Reads the output xml file from the myTMVA step and outputs
    - A histogram file containing histograms of a dataset subject to 100 sets of potentially optimal cuts
    - Text listing the sets of cuts used

--- Usage ---

** Automatic **

0. Make sure ROOT is initialized in the current session.
0.5. For the low pT shell scripts (see below), "start.sh" should be a shell script that sets up the ROOT environment.
1. To use, set the configuration file runTMVA_config.h in the main directory.
2. If desired, edit the appropriate shell script to set the path for log files.
3. Execute the appropriate shell (bash) script, depending on the data being analyzed.
    - run_readxml_L_highpt.sh is for the Lambda + pion channel for bins where pT >= 6
    - run_readxml_K_highpt.sh is for the Kshort + proton channel for bins where pT >= 6
    - run_readxml_L_4to6.sh is for the Lambda + pion channel for bins where 4 <= pT < 6
    - run_readxml_L_lowpt.sh is for the Lambda + pion channel for bins where pT < 6
    - run_readxml_K_lowpt.sh is for the Kshort + proton channel for bins where pT < 6

** Manual **
- Follow the configuration steps as described in the automatic section. Then run the command:

    root -l -b -q 'readxml.cc+(<file_list>, <index>)

- <file_list> is an xml file specifying which paths to files containing the desired background (data) trees to chain together. See the section on the config subdirectory for more informaion.

- <index> is a tag for the output files. Can be an integer or a string. Intended for job-splitting with large datasets.

--- Subdirectories ---

** config **
- Contains file_list xml files
- The top nodes should always be <Files> and <in_files>
- <in_files> should contain:
    - <directory_name>, specifying a directory in the input file in which the input tree is contained. Can be left blank if the tree is directly inside the input file.
    - <tree_name> the name of the tree in the input file.
    - <in_file_*n*>, where *n* is the nth input file.
        - <name_base> is the complete path to the input file. It a {} is included in the name, it will be filled in by the indices (see below). 
        - <index_limits> contains the first and last index for systematically named files. For each index between the first and last indices, the {} (if present) in name_base will be replaced with the index. If the name_base has no {}, index_limits should always be 1,1

** config_util **

- Location to hold the histogram file outputs from readxml

** includes **
- Header files for readxml

** logs **
- Default location for log files for readxml
